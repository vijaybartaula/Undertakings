        <h2>Historical Gold Prices</h2>
        <p>Gold prices have fluctuated significantly over the past century. For example, in the 1920s, gold prices were relatively stable, averaging around $20.67 per ounce. However, significant increases occurred in the 1970s when prices surged due to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, peaking at around $850 per ounce in 1980. Throughout the 2000s, gold prices saw a sharp rise, reaching a record high of over $1,900 per ounce in 2011 due to the global financial crisis.</p>
